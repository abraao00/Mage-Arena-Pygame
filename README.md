# Mage Arena

## Game Concept
Mage Arena is a turn-based 2D game developed with Python and Pygame.
The player controls a mage on a grid-based arena and must survive as many
rounds as possible by moving strategically and defeating enemies.

Enemies spawn over time and use a preparation-based attack system, allowing
the player to anticipate and react. The game focuses on turn management,
positioning, and survival.
